# ansible-openssh-server

A role to install and configure openssh-server on a target host.

## Ansible requirements

### Ansible version

Minimum required ansible version is 2.0.

### Ansible role dependencies

None.

## Installation

### Install with Ansible Galaxy

```shell
ansible-galaxy install archf.openssh-server
```

Basic usage is:

```yaml
- hosts: all
  roles:
    - role: archf.openssh-server
```

### Install with git

If you do not want a global installation, clone it into your `roles_path`.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:archf/ansible-openssh-server.git /path/to/roles_path
```

But I often add it as a submdule in a given `playbook_dir` repository.

```shell
git submodule add git@github.com:archf/ansible-openssh-server.git <playbook_dir>/roles/openssh-server
```

As the role is not managed by Ansible Galaxy, you do not have to specify the
github user account.

Basic usage is:

```yaml
- hosts: all
  roles:
  - role: openssh-server
```
## User Guide

Configure the sshd daemon using one of the variables below:

```yaml
sshd_Port: 22
sshd_PermitRootLogin: 'yes'
sshd_ChallengeResponseAuthentication: 'no'
sshd_GSSAPICleanupCredentials: 'no'
sshd_X11Forwarding: 'yes'
sshd_ClientAliveInterval: 0
sshd_ClientAliveCountMax: 3
sshd_PasswordAuthentication: 'yes'
sshd_Banner: 'none'
```


## Role Variables

Variables are divided in three types.

The [default vars](#default-vars) section shows you which variables you may
override in your ansible inventory. As a matter of fact, all variables should
be defined there for explicitness, ease of documentation as well as overall
role manageability.

The [mandatory variables](#mandatory-variables) section contains variables that
for several reasons do not fit into the default variables. As name implies,
they must absolutely be defined in the inventory or else the role will
fail. It is a good thing to avoid reach for these as much as possible and/or
design the role with clear behavior when they're undefined.

The [context variables](#context-variables) are shown in section below hint you
on how runtime context may affects role execution.

### Default vars

Role default variables from `defaults/main.yml`.

```yaml
# Currently supported settings are those grouped in the hash below. To override
# a setting, create a key in your inventory and prefix it by `sshd_`. Casing
# must be preserved and is the same as per the 'sshd_config' manual. For
# example, to disable 'PasswordAuthentication', your would add the following key
# in Ansible inventory variables: sshd_PasswordAuthentication: 'no'
sshd_defaults:
  Port: 22
  PermitRootLogin: 'yes'
  ChallengeResponseAuthentication: 'no'
  GSSAPICleanupCredentials: 'no'
  X11Forwarding: 'yes'
  ClientAliveInterval: 0
  ClientAliveCountMax: 3
  PasswordAuthentication: 'yes'
  Banner: 'none'

```

### Mandatory variables

None.

### Context variables

Those variables from `vars/*.{yml,json}` are loaded dynamically during task
runtime using the `include_vars` module.

Variables loaded from `vars/Debian.yml`.

```yaml
sshd_service_name: ssh

sshd_packages:
  - openssh-server

```

Variables loaded from `vars/RedHat.yml`.

```yaml
sshd_service_name: sshd

sshd_packages:
  - openssh-server

```
